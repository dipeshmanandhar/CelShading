# CelShading
Project to Render Scenes in Cel (Toon-like) Shading using OpenGL

Warning: This is a Work in Progress.

## Building Notes (for Windows)
* These notes are for building the project in Visual Studio Code. If using Visual Studio, the process is much simpler and you can follow the guides in the [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window) website.
    * The linked page only goes over installing and building GLFW and GLAD, but the tutorial series later describes similar procedures for GLM and Assimp too.
* The compiler used is [mingw-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/)
    * Download the installer, not the zip file
    * Pick the latest version (8.1.0 at the time of this writing), x86_64 architecture, posix threads, seh exceptions, and build revision 0
        * Most of these should be the default, except for the architecture
    * Install mingw-w64 to a folder path with no spaces ("C:\Program Files" is NOT acceptable)
* Use [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) to create the Makefiles to build the libraries and the project
    * Install the GUI as well to make things easier
    * [Reccommended] This can be skipped if using the VSCode CMake & CMake Tools Extensions, just make sure to add some settings to the settings.json in the .vscode folder to set the options for CMake
        * The procedure for using the CMake Tools Extension is to select a Kit (mingw-w64, labelled as GCC 8.1.0), select a Variant (Release or Debug), run CMake: Configure, and finally CMake: Build (this final step is not a part of CMake itself, and actuallly builds the project by running all Makefiles generated by CMake)
* Install and Build the dependancy libraries
    * [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
        * If installing the source code, build the source with the default options set
        * Point CMake to where the GLFW root directory is stored (either via the VSCode extension or CMake GUI or adding -D args to running the cmake CLI)
    * [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
        * Select the latest version of the gl API (Version 4.6 at the time of this writing), Core Profile, and make sure that the "Generate a loader" box is checked
        * GLAD does not require the source to be built, just need tell CMake where the include directory and glad.c files are
        * Do this by pointing CMake to where the GLAD root directory is stored
    * [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/index.html)
        * Click on the Downloads tab on the right side, and download the latest version (0.9.9.8 as of this writing) from GitHub
        * GLM is an all-header library so no need to build anything, just need to tell CMake where the include directory is
        * Do this by pointing CMake to where the GLM root directory is stored
    * [Assimp](https://www.assimp.org/index.php/downloads)
        * Click on the link for the latest release (5.0.1 at the time of this writing) and download the source from GitHub
        * Assimp is required to be built and needs very specific CMake settings when using mingw-w64 as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61692793/assimp-cmake-mingw-w64-vscode-win10)
            * `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF -DASSIMP_BUILD_ASSIMP_TOOLS:BOOL=OFF -DASSIMP_HEADERCHECK:BOOL=OFF -DASSIMP_OPT_BUILD_PACKAGES:BOOL=OFF -DSYSTEM_IRRXML:BOOL=OFF -DASSIMP_BUILD_SAMPLES:BOOL=OFF -DBUILD_DOCS:BOOL=OFF -DASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS:BOOL=OFF -S. -Bbuild_win`
        * After building Assimp, point CMake to where the Assimp root directory is stored
* Build the whole project and run it by running ./build/CelShading.exe at the project root directory!
    * Note that the exe file must be run from the project root directory, as this is the directory where the Resources/ folder is located in.
